My own darling Florence!
	I returned from Baltimore on Monday of this week & go to the Army tomorrow morning. I went and had some photographs taken yesterday. Vignette style. They will be finished on Saturday and forwarded to me at the Batty. I found the pictures that had been taken from the Ambrotype but did not like them. I got one however to send to you, but I would prefer that you would not place it in a very conspicuous position. I hope that the new ones will be better. I begin to feel anxious to get back to the Battery and shall feel very much relieved when I get out of this dull place. Lt. Williston is going back with me.
	I have not as yet returned Alice's letters, but shall do so as soon as I get back to the Army.
	I went to the Express Office today to make inquiries about the Bible & Smoking Cap you sent me but could find nothing of them. They may however have been sent down to the Army & I will get them there. I hope to receive a letter from you when I reach the Batty and right glad will I be to hear from my very very dear Florence.
	Has your Father returned yet? If so has anything been said to him about the relations existing between yourself & I? And what did he say? I hope you have told your Mother of our engagement. As I should not be satisfied to have anything clandestine about the matter. I am desirous that your Parents should not be deceived in anything. Your Mother has been so very kind to me that I feel like placing the utmost confidence in her.
	As I have an engagement this evening with some Army friends you must excuse me if I do not write a very long letter. Though short I hope it will be sweet to you.
Remember me to Your Mother & the rest of my friends. And write me very often.
I remain
Your own affectionate
Jim
