Near Chain Bridge Virginia Sept. 15, 1861 Dear Mother; Since I last wrote I have been very busy. We occupy an exposed point, our pickets are constantly in hot water with the enemy's, Gen. Smith stampedes and we are continually in a state of alarm. Night before last we had a grand stampede, the troops were all under arms for some time and occupying position all about, strong working parties were busily digging in the trenches until after midnight and the troops were finally ordered to lie down on the ground besides the trenches with their arms in order to be ready at a moments notice; yet no enemy made his appearance, and we had our trouble for our pains. I say "we" for convenience, but I sleep in a house and don't wake up for any alarms. I have been in two small fights since my arrival. They didn't either amount to much, so I wasn't much frightened. The shells and rifle cannon they talk so much about don't amount to much. I was exposed to their fire and take this opportunity to expose them. If they hit a man they may hurt him but I saw 30, or 40, of them go way over the heads of our troops and burst 200 yards beyond them. Whenever a shell would come the men and officers would drop on their hands and feet and "sing small". They were just as safe standing up, but didn't have sense enough to see it. I will write you more fully soon. Love to the children & c. Your affectionate son Hazard Stevens
